Context
    The app needs a consistent and visually appealing UI across iOS and Android platforms. The chosen framework should be easy to integrate and customize, and it should support the development of a high-quality user interface that enhances the user experience.

Decision
    React Native's built in UI components will be used

Rational
    Consistency
        React Native provides a consistent look and feel across platforms, which is important for maintaining a uniform user experience.
    Community Support
        React Native Paper is widely used and well-supported, ensuring we have access to a robust set of components and support.
    Customizable
        Easily customizable to meet specific design requirements of the transportation app.

Consequences
    What makes this AD easier is it provides a consistent look and feel across platforms as well as simplifies UI development with ready to use components

    What makes this AD more difficult is it might face customization limitations using complex UI elements as opposed to building custom components
